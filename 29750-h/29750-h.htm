<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">It's</span> difficult, when you're on
one of the asteroids, to keep
from tripping, because it's
almost impossible to keep your
eyes on the ground. They never
got around to putting portholes
in spaceships, you know&mdash;unnecessary
when you're flying by GB,
and psychologically inadvisable,
besides&mdash;so an asteroid is about
the only place, apart from Luna,
where you can really see the stars.</p>

<p>There are so many stars in an
asteroid sky that they look like
clouds; like massive, heaped-up
silver clouds floating slowly
around the inner surface of the
vast ebony sphere that surrounds
you and your tiny foothold. They
are near enough to touch, and
you want to touch them, but they
are so frighteningly far away ...
and so beautiful: there's nothing
in creation half so beautiful as
an asteroid sky.</p>

<p>You don't want to look down,
naturally.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">I&nbsp;had</span> left the <i>Lucky Pierre</i> to
search for fossils (I'm David
Koontz, the <i>Lucky Pierre</i>'s paleontologist).
Somewhere off in
the darkness on either side of me
were Joe Hargraves, gadgeting
for mineral deposits, and Ed
Reiss, hopefully on the lookout
for anything alive. The <i>Lucky
Pierre</i> was back of us, her body
out of sight behind a low black
ridge, only her gleaming nose
poking above like a porpoise
coming up for air. When I looked
back, I could see, along the jagged
rim of the ridge, the busy
reflected flickerings of the bubble-camp
the techs were throwing
together. Otherwise all was black,
except for our blue-white torch
beams that darted here and there
over the gritty, rocky surface.</p>

<p>The twenty-nine of us were
E.T.I. Team 17, whose assignment
was the asteroids. We were
four years and three months out
of Terra, and we'd reached Vesta
right on schedule. Ten minutes
after landing, we had known that
the clod was part of the crust of
Planet X&mdash;or Sorn, to give it its
right name&mdash;one of the few such
parts that hadn't been blown
clean out of the Solar System.</p>

<p>That made Vesta extra-special.
It meant settling down for a
while. It meant a careful, months-long
scrutiny of Vesta's every
square inch and a lot of her cubic
ones, especially by the life-scientists.
Fossils, artifacts, animate
life ... a surface chunk of Sorn
might harbor any of these, or all.
Some we'd tackled already had
a few.</p>

<p>In a day or so, of course, we'd
have the one-man beetles and
crewboats out, and the floodlights
orbiting overhead, and Vesta
would be as exposed to us as a
molecule on a microscreen. Then
work would start in earnest. But
in the meantime&mdash;and as usual&mdash;Hargraves,
Reiss and I were out
prowling, our weighted boots
clomping along in darkness. Captain
Feldman had long ago given
up trying to keep his science-minded
charges from galloping
off alone like this. In spite of
being a military man, Feld's a
nice guy; he just shrugs and says,
"Scientists!" when we appear
brightly at the airlock, waiting to
be let out.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">So</span> the three of us went our separate
ways, and soon were
out of sight of one another. Ed
Reiss, the biologist, was looking
hardest for animate life, naturally.</p>

<p>But I found it.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">I&nbsp;had</span> crossed a long, rounded
expanse of rock&mdash;lava, wonderfully
colored&mdash;and was descending
into a boulder-cluttered
pocket. I was nearing the "bottom"
of the chunk, the part that
had been the deepest beneath
Sorn's surface before the blow-up.
It was the likeliest place to look
for fossils.</p>

<p>But instead of looking for fossils,
my eyes kept rising to those
incredible stars. You get that way
particularly after several weeks
of living in steel; and it was
lucky that I got that way this
time, or I might have missed the
Zen.</p>

<p>My feet tangled with a rock.
I started a slow, light-gravity fall,
and looked down to catch my
balance. My torch beam flickered
across a small, red-furred teddy-bear
shape. The light passed on.
I brought it sharply back to
target.</p>

<p>My hair did <i>not</i> stand on end,
regardless of what you've heard
me quoted as saying. Why should
it have, when I already knew
Yurt so well&mdash;considered him, in
fact, one of my closest friends?</p>

<p>The Zen was standing by a
rock, one paw resting on it, ears
cocked forward, its stubby hind
legs braced ready to launch it
into flight. Big yellow eyes
blinked unemotionally at the
glare of the torch, and I cut down
its brilliance with a twist of the
polarizer lens.</p>

<p>The creature stared at me,
looking ready to jump halfway
to Mars or straight at me if I
made a wrong move.</p>

<p>I addressed it in its own language,
clucking my tongue and
whistling through my teeth:
"Suh, Zen&mdash;"</p>

<p>In the blue-white light of the
torch, the Zen shivered. It didn't
say anything. I thought I knew
why. Three thousand years of
darkness and silence ...</p>

<p>I said, "I won't hurt you,"
again speaking in its own language.</p>

<p>The Zen moved away from the
rock, but not away from me. It
came a little closer, actually, and
peered up at my helmeted, mirror-glassed
head&mdash;unmistakably
the seat of intelligence, it appears,
of any race anywhere. Its mouth,
almost human-shaped, worked;
finally words came. It hadn't
spoken, except to itself, for three
thousand years.</p>

<p>"You ... are not Zen," it said.
"Why&mdash;how do you speak Zennacai?"</p>

<p>It took me a couple of seconds
to untangle the squeaking syllables
and get any sense out of
them. What I had already said
to it were stock phrases that Yurt
had taught me; I knew still more,
but I couldn't speak Zennacai
fluently by any means. Keep this
in mind, by the way: I barely
knew the language, and the Zen
could barely remember it. To
save space, the following dialogue
is reproduced without bumblings,
blank stares and <i>What-did-you-says</i>?
In reality, our talk lasted
over an hour.</p>

<p>"I am an Earthman," I said.
Through my earphones, when I
spoke, I could faintly hear my
own voice as the Zen must have
heard it in Vesta's all but nonexistent
atmosphere: tiny, metallic,
cricket-like.</p>

<p>"Eert ... mn?"</p>

<p>I pointed at the sky, the incredible
sky. "From out there.
From another world."</p>

<p>It thought about that for a
while. I waited. We already knew
that the Zens had been better astronomers
at their peak than we
were right now, even though
they'd never mastered space
travel; so I didn't expect this one
to boggle at the notion of creatures
from another world. It
didn't. Finally it nodded, and I
thought, as I had often before,
how curious it was that this gesture
should be common to Earthmen
and Zen.</p>

<p>"So. Eert-mn," it said. "And
you know what I am?"</p>

<p>When I understood, I nodded,
too. Then I said, "Yes," realizing
that the nod wasn't visible
through the one-way glass of my
helmet.</p>

<p>"I am&mdash;last of Zen," it said.</p>

<p>I said nothing. I was studying
it closely, looking for the features
which Yurt had described to us:
the lighter red fur of arms and
neck, the peculiar formation of
flesh and horn on the lower abdomen.
They were there. From
the coloring, I knew this Zen was
a female.</p>

<p>The mouth worked again&mdash;not
with emotion, I knew, but with
the unfamiliar act of speaking.
"I have been here for&mdash;for&mdash;"
she hesitated&mdash;"I don't know.
For five hundred of my years."</p>

<p>"For about three thousand of
mine," I told her.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">And</span> then blank astonishment
sank home in me&mdash;astonishment
at the last two words of her
remark. I was already familiar
with the Zens' enormous intelligence,
knowing Yurt as I did ... but
imagine thinking to qualify
<i>years</i> with <i>my</i> when just out of
nowhere a visitor from another
planetary orbit pops up! And
there had been no special stress
given the distinction, just clear,
precise thinking, like Yurt's.</p>

<p>I added, still a little awed:
"We know how long ago your
world died."</p>

<p>"I was child then," she said,
"I don't know&mdash;what happened.
I have wondered." She looked up
at my steel-and-glass face; I
must have seemed like a giant.
Well, I suppose I was. "This&mdash;what
we are on&mdash;was part of
Sorn, I know. Was it&mdash;" She
fumbled for a word&mdash;"was it
atom explosion?"</p>

<p>I told her how Sorn had gotten
careless with its hydrogen atoms
and had blown itself over half of
creation. (This the E.T.I. Teams
had surmised from scientific records
found on Eros, as well as
from geophysical evidence scattered
throughout the other bodies.)</p>

<p>"I was child," she said again
after a moment. "But I remember&mdash;I
remember things <i>different</i>
from this. Air ... heat ... light
... how do I live here?"</p>

<p>Again I felt amazement at its
intelligence; (and it suddenly occurred
to me that astronomy and
nuclear physics must have been
taught in Sorn's "elementary
schools"&mdash;else that <i>my years</i> and
<i>atom explosion</i> would have been
all but impossible). And now this
old, old creature, remembering
back three thousand years to
childhood&mdash;probably to those
"elementary schools"&mdash;remembering,
and defining the differences
in environment between
<i>then</i> and <i>now</i>; and more, wondering
at its existence in the
different <i>now</i>&mdash;</p>

<p>And then I got my own thinking
straightened out. I recalled
some of the things we had
learned about the Zen.</p>

<p>Their average lifespan had been
12,000 years or a little over. So
the Zen before me was, by our
standards, about twenty-five
years old. Nothing at all strange
about remembering, when you
are twenty-five, the things that
happened to you when you were
seven ...</p>

<p>But the Zen's question, even
my rationalization of my reaction
to it, had given me a chill.
Here was no cuddly teddy bear.</p>

<p>This creature had been born
before Christ!</p>

<p>She had been alone for three
thousand years, on a chip of bone
from her dead world beneath a
sepulchre of stars. The last and
greatest Martian civilization, the
<i>L'hrai</i>, had risen and fallen in
her lifetime. And she was twenty-five
years old.</p>

<p>"How do I live here?" she
asked again.</p>

<p>I got back into my own framework
of temporal reference, so
to speak, and began explaining
to a Zen what a Zen was. (I
found out later from Yurt that
biology, for the reasons which
follow, was one of the most difficult
studies; so difficult that
nuclear physics actually <i>preceded</i>
it!) I told her that the Zen had
been, all evidence indicated, the
toughest, hardest, longest-lived
creatures God had ever cooked
up: practically independent of
their environment, no special
ecological niche; just raw, stubborn,
tenacious life, developed to
a fantastic extreme&mdash;a greater
force of life than any other
known, one that could exist almost
anywhere under practically
any conditions&mdash;even floating in
midspace, which, asteroid or no,
this Zen was doing right now.</p>

<p>The Zens breathed, all right,
but it was nothing they'd had
to do in order to live. It gave
them nothing their incredible metabolism
couldn't scrounge up
out of rock or cosmic rays or
interstellar gas or simply do without
for a few thousand years. If
the human body is a furnace,
then the Zen body is a feeder
pile. Maybe that, I thought, was
what evolution always worked
toward.</p>

<p>"Please, will you kill me?" the
Zen said.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">I'd</span> been expecting that. Two
years ago, on the bleak surface
of Eros, Yurt had asked Engstrom
to do the same thing. But I asked,
"Why?" although I knew what
the answer would be, too.</p>

<p>The Zen looked up at me. She
was exhibiting every ounce of
emotion a Zen is capable of, which
is a lot; and I could recognize
it, but not in any familiar terms.
A tiny motion here, a quiver
there, but very quiet and still for
the most part. And <i>that</i> was the
violent expression: restraint.
Yurt, after two years of living
with us, still couldn't understand
why we found this confusing.</p>

<p>Difficult, aliens&mdash;or being alien.</p>

<p>"I've tried so often to do it
myself," the Zen said softly. "But
I can't. I can't even hurt myself.
Why do I want you to kill me?"
She was even quieter. Maybe she
was crying. "I'm alone. Five hundred
years, Eert-mn&mdash;not too
long. I'm still young. But what
good is it&mdash;life&mdash;when there are
no other Zen?"</p>

<p>"How do you know there are
no other Zen?"</p>

<p>"There are no others," she said
almost inaudibly. I suppose a human
girl might have shrieked it.</p>

<p><i>A child</i>, I thought, <i>when your
world blew up. And you survived.
Now you're a young three-thousand-year-old
woman ... uneducated,
afraid, probably crawling
with neuroses. Even so, in your
thousand-year terms, young lady,
you're not too old to change.</i></p>

<p>"Will you kill me?" she asked
again.</p>

<p>And suddenly I was having one
of those eye-popping third-row-center
views of the whole scene:
the enormous, beautiful sky; the
dead clod, Vesta; the little creature
who stood there staring at me&mdash;the
brilliant-ignorant, humanlike-alien,
old-young creature who
was asking me to kill her.</p>

<p>For a moment the human quality
of her thinking terrified me
... the feeling you might have
waking up some night and finding
your pet puppy sitting on
your chest, looking at you with
wise eyes and white fangs gleaming ...</p>

<p>Then I thought of Yurt&mdash;smart,
friendly Yurt, who had
learned to laugh and wisecrack&mdash;and
I came out of the jeebies. I
realized that here was only a sick
girl, no tiny monster. And if she
were as resilient as Yurt ... well,
it was his problem. He'd probably
pull her through.</p>

<p>But I didn't pick her up. I
made no attempt to take her back
to the ship. Her tiny white teeth
and tiny yellow claws were
harder than steel; and she was,
I knew, unbelievably strong for
her size. If she got suspicious or
decided to throw a phobic tizzy,
she could scatter shreds of me
over a square acre of Vesta in
less time than it would take me
to yelp.</p>

<p>"Will you&mdash;" she began again.</p>

<p>I tried shakily, "Hell, no. Wait
here." Then I had to translate it.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">I&nbsp;went</span> back to the <i>Lucky
Pierre</i> and got Yurt. We could
do without him, even though he
had been a big help. We'd taught
him a lot&mdash;he'd been a child at
the blow-up, too&mdash;and he'd
taught us a lot. But this was
more important, of course.</p>

<p>When I told him what had
happened, he was very quiet; crying,
perhaps, just like a human
being, with happiness.</p>

<p>Cap Feldman asked me what
was up, and I told him, and he
said, "Well, I'll be blessed!"</p>

<p>I said, "Yurt, are you sure you
want us to keep hands off ...
just go off and leave you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, please."</p>

<p>Feldman said, "Well, I'll be
blessed."</p>

<p>Yurt, who spoke excellent English,
said, "Bless you all."</p>

<p>I took him back to where the
female waited. From the ridge, I
knew, the entire crew was watching
through binocs. I set him
down, and he fell to studying her
intently.</p>

<p>"I am not a Zen," I told her,
giving my torch full brilliance
for the crew's sake, "but Yurt
here is. Do you see ... I mean,
do you know what you look
like?"</p>

<p>She said, "I can see enough of
my own body to&mdash;and&mdash;yes ..."</p>

<p>"Yurt," I said, "here's the female
we thought we might find.
Take over."</p>

<p>Yurt's eyes were fastened on
the girl.</p>

<p>"What&mdash;do I do now?" she
whispered worriedly.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid that's something
only a Zen would know," I told
her, smiling inside my helmet.
"I'm not a Zen. Yurt is."</p>

<p>She turned to him. "You will
tell me?"</p>

<p>"If it becomes necessary." He
moved closer to her, not even
looking back to talk to me. "Give
us some time to get acquainted,
will you, Dave? And you might
leave some supplies and a bubble
at the camp when you move on,
just to make things pleasanter."</p>

<p>By this time he had reached
the female. They were as still as
space, not a sound, not a motion.
I wanted to hang around, but I
knew how I'd feel if a Zen, say,
wouldn't go away if I were the
last man alive and had just met
the last woman.</p>

<p>I moved my torch off them
and headed back for the <i>Lucky
Pierre</i>. We all had a drink to the
saving of a great race that might
have become extinct. Ed Reiss,
though, had to do some worrying
before he could down his drink.</p>

<p>"What if they don't like each
other?" he asked anxiously.</p>

<p>"They don't have much
choice," Captain Feldman said,
always the realist. "Why do
homely women fight for jobs on
the most isolated space outposts?"</p>

<p>Reiss grinned. "That's right.
They look awful good after a
year or two in space."</p>

<p>"Make that twenty-five by Zen
standards or three thousand by
ours," said Joe Hargraves, "and
I'll bet they look beautiful to
each other."</p>

<p>We decided to drop our investigation
of Vesta for the time
being, and come back to it after
the honeymoon.</p>

<p>Six months later, when we returned,
there were twelve hundred
Zen on Vesta!</p>

<p>Captain Feldman was a realist
but he was also a deeply moral
man. He went to Yurt and said,
"It's indecent! Couldn't the two
of you control yourselves at least
a little? <i>Twelve hundred kids!</i>"</p>

<p>"We were rather surprised ourselves,"
Yurt said complacently.
"But this seems to be how Zen
reproduce. Can you have only
half a child?"</p>

<p>Naturally, Feld got the authorities
to quarantine Vesta. Good
God, the Zen could push us clear
out of the Solar System in a couple
of generations!</p>

<p>I don't think they would, but
you can't take such chances, can
you?</p>
